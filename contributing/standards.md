## Brownbook Standards and Review Checklist

Try to follow this list of standards when writing content for brownbook. Reviewers can and should refer to this list while reviewing brownbook content.

### General
* Content should be free of spelling, grammar, punctuation, or formatting errors.
* Each sentence should be on its own line. In Markdown a paragraph break is done by 2 line breaks. Each sentence on one line makes reviewing and suggesting easier when it is time to process a pull request.

### "Meta"
* Use "brownbook" as a proper noun, not "the brownbook"
* Brownbook is not capitalized unless it is in a title or at the beginning of a sentence.

### Controls
* Use backticks like `` `text` `` to reference code or code items in regular text.

### Pictures/Video
* All linked images should be hosted from the github repository.
* Images should be of an appropriate-looking size for the page. Exact size consistency is not required, but full screen screenshots that dominate pages may not be appropriate depending on the topic.
* All video should be hosted on the team youtube account (unlisted is fine/encouraged).
